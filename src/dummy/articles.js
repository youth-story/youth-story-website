        content: 'Priyanshi Mishra is an extraordinary young individual who has accomplished remarkable feats at the tender age of 18. She is a trailblazer who has scaled impressive heights even before embarking on her journey into adulthood. Her achievements are not merely a product of luck, but the result of unwavering dedication, countless hours of hard work, and an unyielding belief in her potential. However, it is not only her remarkable accomplishments that make her story so captivating; it is also her genuine humility, down-to-earth nature, and passion for making a positive difference in the world. Despite her achievements, she remains grounded and continues to seek new ways to grow and contribute to society.\n\nCan you tell us about your experience as the vice-captain in DPS Indore? What responsibilities did this role entail, and how did you contribute to the school community?\nAs the vice house captain in my school, I had various responsibilities. I assisted the house warden in organizing events, motivated house members, and fostered unity. Representing the house in competitions, coordinating activities, and bridging the gap between students and the administration were also part of my role. Through fulfilling these duties, I served my school community and gained valuable leadership skills. It was an honour to make a positive impact and contribute to my school\'s vibrant atmosphere. The experience taught me valuable leadership skills, such as effective communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.

Could you share some of your achievements or notable experiences in this martial art?\nIn 4th grade, I chose Taekwondo as my sport and embarked on a journey focused on self-defence, discipline, and personal growth. I progressed through various belt exams, showcasing my kicking and punching skills and breaking tiles. I personally found joy in participating in these belt exams, which felt like annual assessments for Taekwondo. Competitions brought both excitement and fear, but I overcame the challenges and achieved notable success. Over time, however, I grew accustomed to the competitive atmosphere and even achieved notable success. I earned a silver medal in an inter-school competition, several bronze medals in other competitions, and secured the first position in my school\'s house. Taekwondo has been a rewarding sport, challenging me physically and mentally while creating unforgettable experiences and achievements.\n\nAs a community volunteer, what type of work have you been involved in? How has this experience impacted you personally, and what lessons have you learned from it?\nLast year, I joined Tribes for Good, an NGO, as a community volunteer focusing on gender equality and social justice. We organized sessions for underprivileged children, raising awareness about gender inequality, human trafficking, and child marriage. These issues are particularly prevalent in less developed areas where children are vulnerable to exploitation. We aimed to empower them by providing knowledge and resources to protect themselves.\nInspired by my volunteer work, a friend and I started a group. Our goal was to raise awareness about mental health and address social issues. We recognized the stigma surrounding mental health and aimed to create a supportive environment for individuals to seek help without judgment. Stress and depression are common among teenagers, and we felt the need to provide accessible support networks. We conducted sessions primarily in orphanages, creating a safe space for individuals to discuss their struggles without fear of judgment.\n\nThese experiences had a profound impact on me. I developed empathy and gained a deeper understanding of social issues. Working with diverse communities improved my teamwork, leadership, and communication skills. Above all, volunteering taught me the importance of giving back to society and using my privileges to help others. It opened my eyes to the broader realities of the world and instilled a sense of responsibility in me.\n\nWe understand that you are a Kathak dancer who has represented India internationally. Could you tell us about your journey in dance and how you managed to reach such high achievements?\nDance, particularly Kathak, has been an integral part of my life since the age of 2. Through years of practice and performances, Kathak has not only shaped my dance skills but also moulded my character. The emphasis on expressions and graceful movements in Kathak has taught me patience, kindness, and discipline. I have participated in various competitions, representing India on an international level and achieving recognition at esteemed events like the World Cup of Folklore in Italy and Bulgaria. These experiences have taught me independence, emotional resilience, and the significance of preparation and teamwork.\n\nMy journey in dance would not have been possible without the unwavering support of my guru, Dr Ragini Makkad, and my parents. Their belief in my abilities, guidance, and help in balancing academics and dance have been invaluable. Under my guru\'s exceptional mentorship, I have gained confidence, discipline, perseverance, and a strong work ethic. I am deeply grateful for her influence and for the opportunities she has provided, allowing me to flourish as a dancer.\n\nI am immensely grateful to my guru, Dr Ragini Makkad mam, for believing in my potential and supporting me throughout my dance journey. Her unwavering faith in me has been instrumental in my achievements.

These experiences have been both rewarding and have contributed to my growth as a dancer.\n\nHow do you balance your academic commitments with your extracurricular activities? Has this balance ever posed challenges for you, and if so, how did you overcome them?\nBalancing academics and extracurriculars is a challenge, but I\'ve learned to manage them effectively through time management and prioritization. Both are important for my future goals. My schedule includes school, coaching, studying, dance classes, and revision. I adjust my schedule based on specific needs, giving more time to practice or study when required. Balance doesn\'t mean equal time in every aspect, but finding a rhythm to excel in both areas. Disruptions happen, but I learn from them. Everyone has their own pace, so planning should be personalized.\nBy dedicating myself and following a personalized plan, I can effectively manage both academics and extracurricular commitments, ultimately achieving a harmonious balance in my life.\n\nCan you share an instance where you faced a significant challenge either in school, sports, or community service? How did you handle it, and what did you learn from that experience?\nDuring a national-level dance competition, I encountered a challenging experience. As I practised my spins, I developed a blister on my heel, which was crucial for my performance. Despite the discomfort, I continued practising, assuming it would heal in time. However, the day before the competition, the blister worsened and started bleeding. I was terrified and in pain, unable to complete my spins properly. We travelled to Pune, where the competition was held. On the day of the performance, I was anxious and fearful of messing up such a significant opportunity. I had both a solo and a group performance scheduled.\nSummoning my courage, I reminded myself that it was a do-or-die moment. I embraced the pain, knowing it was just a temporary obstacle. With determination, I took the stage and gave it my all, forgetting about the injury in the heat of the performance. In the end, my efforts paid off, and I achieved success in the competition. This experience taught me a valuable lesson – obstacles are an inevitable part of life\'s journey. They cannot be avoided or prevented. Instead, they should be faced head-on. Overcoming hurdles strengthens us and leads to personal growth.\nSimilarly, fear is another hurdle that we must confront. Whether it\'s the anxiety before a performance or an exam, once we push through it, a sense of relief and accomplishment washes over us. This incident reinforced the notion that challenges, when confronted with determination and resilience, can lead to great rewards.\n\nLooking ahead, what are your future aspirations and goals? How do you plan to continue pursuing your passions while also pursuing higher education or a career?\nCurrently, my primary goal is to secure admission into a reputable university and receive a quality education. Concurrently, I aim to continue my involvement in extracurricular activities as they hold immense value in my life. Consequently, I am applying to universities abroad due to their recognition of my extracurricular accomplishments. I believe that my profile aligns well with their emphasis on both academics and extracurriculars, which is why I am pursuing this opportunity.\nMy intended field of study is economics and psychology, as I find these subjects immensely intriguing. Particularly, the field of behavioural economics captivates me, although I envision exploring other business-related opportunities as well. The realm of commerce, including the stock market and economic aspects, fascinates me, and I aim to leverage my knowledge in these areas. Ultimately, my aspiration is to represent my country globally and make my parents proud.\nI am indebted to my parents and teachers for their unwavering support, and I recognize that I can never fully repay them. However, making them proud by embodying the values they instilled in me and showcasing my achievements would be a gratifying way to express my gratitude. Their pride and happiness would be more than enough for me, as it would signify that their efforts were fruitful.\n\nWhat suggestions do you have for people of the same age as you who want to pursue a dream similar to yours?\nTo achieve success in any field, it is important to identify and pursue one\'s passion while setting clear goals. Breaking down the big picture into smaller, achievable goals allows for focused efforts. Embracing a growth mindset, viewing setbacks as opportunities for growth, and learning from failures is crucial. Consistency is key, whether it\'s studying for exams or preparing for competitions. Seeking mentorship from successful individuals and building a network of like-minded individuals provide guidance, collaboration, and opportunities. The internet offers vast resources, from online platforms to social media, that can aid in learning, connecting, and exploring opportunities. While using social media wisely, it can be a powerful tool for growth and recognition. Maintaining a positive mindset, utilizing available resources, and embracing hard work and dedication are key factors in pursuing one\'s passion and achieving success.\n\nCould you please share some tips? Furthermore, can you mention some platforms where they can pursue their dreams, as many people are unaware of such platforms?\n\nThe Internet offers a wealth of resources for learning and exploring new opportunities. Platforms like YouTube provide endless channels that teach various subjects, including dance, music, and even stock market courses.
